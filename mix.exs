        Elixir crypto library to encrypt/decrypt arbitrary binaries. It uses
        Erlang Crypto, so it's not big deal. Mostly a collection of helpers
        wrapping it. It allows to use a crypted key to validate signed requests.
        The exact same cipher is implemented for Python, Ruby and Elixir, so it
        can be used to integrate apps from different languages.
